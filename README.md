# AI ChatBot  

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI ChatBot for trip booking and FAQ
Autoresponder trained with JSON intents to answer all your travel booking necessities

## Background

Saves time and the constraints in getting to book a trip and hotel reservation where the traveller would not have to fill lenghty forms on a presupposed website before making their booking and also reduces the cost of rates and telephone prompters? Frequent travellers requiring urgent trip cancellation or rescheduling? The trauma I encountered when I missed my flight and the need for a one-on-one phone chat with the airline operators where I coudld have just initialised an AI ChatBot trained on terabytes of RAM? Stutern has been my basic foundation exposing me to the rudiments and fundamentals of AI with personal TA George Igwegbe (AI Engineer) my mentor?

List of tools used
* TKinter
* AI Chatbot
* Python
* Jupyter Lab
* JSON


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
python AI_Chatboy.py
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
